Overthewire bandit is a Linux CTF that's challenging but fun. I chose to write about this specific bandit because how challenging it was.

Goal of the challenge:
The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed. For this level it may be useful to create a directory under /tmp in which you can work using mkdir. For example: mkdir /tmp/myname123. Then copy the datafile using cp, and rename it using mv (read the manpages!)

We are given a list of Linux commands that might be useful:
grep, sort, uniq, strings, base64, tr, tar, gzip, bzip2, xxd, mkdir, cp, mv, file

And finally a Wikipedia page that explains what a Hex dump is.


First, let's SSH into the given host which is:
ssh bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 -l bandit12
Password: 5Te8Y4drgCRfCx8ugdwuEX8KFC6k2EUu

Once we're in we need to find the data.txt file

bandit12@bandit:~$ ls
data.txt

Now we need to create a folder in /tmp then copy data.txt there.

bandit12@bandit:~$ mkdir /tmp/myname123
bandit12@bandit:~$ cp data.txt /tmp/myname123
bandit12@bandit:~$ cd /tmp/myname123
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/myname123$ ls
data.txt

Next, according to the challenge "The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed."
We need to figure out what type of compression it is so we can decompress it.

bandit12@bandit:/tmp/myname123$ file data.txt 
data.txt: ASCII text

The file contains ASCII, a hex dump. What we can do is use xxd -r to reverse the hex dump into binary then dump it into a file.

bandit12@bandit:/tmp/myname123$ file data.txt 
data.txt: ASCII text
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/myname123$ xxd -r data.txt data

Now when we check the file type of our new file "data" we get this

bandit12@bandit:/tmp/myname123$ file data
data: gzip compressed data, was "data2.bin", last modified: Thu May  7 18:14:30 2020, max compression, from Unix

This means that the file type can be converted to gzip then decompressed with gzip -d. "-d" for decompress.

bandit12@bandit:/tmp/myname123$ mv data data.gz
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/myname123$ gzip -d data.gz 
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/myname123$ ls
data  data.txt

Now this will be a little repetitive so bear with it. We got a data file from the data.gz. The next steps will be to: check file type -> convert -> decompress -> repeat until we get the file that contains the password for bandit13.

bandit12@bandit:/tmp/myname123$ file data
data: bzip2 compressed data, block size = 900k
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/myname123$ mv data data.bz2
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/myname123$ bzip2 -d data.bz2 
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/myname123$ ls
data  data.txt

Above we got a bzip file type this time, but the process is still the same.

bandit12@bandit:/tmp/myname123$ file data
data: gzip compressed data, was "data4.bin", last modified: Thu May  7 18:14:30 2020, max compression, from Unix
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/myname123$ mv data data.gz
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/myname123$ gzip -d data.gz 
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/myname123$ ls
data  data.txt

Below we got a tar file type, the way to extract is with tar xvf, it extracts and views the extracted file afterwards.

bandit12@bandit:/tmp/myname123$ file data
data: POSIX tar archive (GNU)
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/myname123$ mv data data.tar
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/myname123$ tar xvf data.tar
data5.bin
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/myname123$ ls
data5.bin  data.tar  data.txt

We got a .bin file, that's new...

andit12@bandit:/tmp/myname123$ file data5.bin 
data5.bin: POSIX tar archive (GNU)
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/myname123$ mv data5.bin data5.tar
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/myname123$ tar xvf data5.tar 
data6.bin

bandit12@bandit:/tmp/myname123$ file data6.bin 
data6.bin: bzip2 compressed data, block size = 900k
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/myname123$ mv data6.bin data6.bz2
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/myname123$ bzip2 -d data6.bz2 
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/myname123$ ls
data5.tar  data6  data.tar  data.txt

bandit12@bandit:/tmp/myname123$ file data6
data6: POSIX tar archive (GNU)
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/myname123$ mv data6 data6.tar
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/myname123$ tar xvf data6.tar 
data8.bin

bandit12@bandit:/tmp/myname123$ file data8.bin 
data8.bin: gzip compressed data, was "data9.bin", last modified: Thu May  7 18:14:30 2020, max compression, from Unix
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/myname123$ mv data8.bin data8.gz
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/myname123$ gzip -d data8.gz 
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/myname123$ ls
data5.tar  data6.tar  data8  data.tar  data.txt

bandit12@bandit:/tmp/myname123$ file data8 
data8: ASCII text
bandit12@bandit:/tmp/myname123$ cat data8 
The password is 8ZjyCRiBWFYkneahHwxCv3wb2a1ORpYL

And there you have, the password for bandit12. Thanks for reading!
