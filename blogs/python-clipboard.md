Python Clipboard
================

Mar 6, 2022

The [script](https://github.com/waleed110/redesigned-goggles) allows users to save multiple keywords and access them on-demand. it uses pyperclip to paste the words stored in sys.argv into a file called mcb.

Listing the keywords pastes the content of file mcb into the clipboard.

`['third', 'fourth', 'second', 'first']`


Code Breakdown:
---------------

sys.argv is a list in Python, which contains the command-line arguments passed to the script. The sys.argv list always has the name of the script file on index 0. When the user calls the script with "save _keyword_" an if statement checks the length of sys.argv if it's 3 (length starts from 1, index starts from 0). name of the file will be at index 0, `save` at index 1 and the keyword at index 2. In that case pyperclip will paste the keyword in index 2 to the file mcb.

`delete` has similar code to `save` but instead of pasting to mcb it deletes the keyword from the file.

If sys.argv only receives a command and no keyword, check if it's `list` or `clear`. list will copy all keywords from the mcb file to the clipboard by converting all keywords from list to string.

_clear_ will loop over all keywords in the file and delete them one by one.

And finally, if the user wants a saved keyword pasted into the clipboard they can type `py mcb.pyw keyword`.
